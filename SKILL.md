# TikTok Automation API

This skill describes the hosted TikTok automation API(`https://tiktok.palmyr.ai`). For a fully local option, install the repository as an MCP server instead.

## Discover and call

```bash
npx agentcash@latest add https://tiktok.palmyr.ai
npx agentcash@latest discover https://tiktok.palmyr.ai
npx agentcash@latest check https://tiktok.palmyr.ai/v1/post
```

AgentCash handles the x402 challenge and payment automatically:

```bash
npx agentcash@latest fetch https://tiktok.palmyr.ai/v1/connect \
  -m POST \
  -b '{"account_id":"my-brand"}'
```

Open the returned `connect_url`, scan the TikTok QR code, then poll the returned `poll_url`. The wallet that pays for the connection owns the account; use the same wallet for later actions.

Post a public video URL after the account is connected:

```bash
npx agentcash@latest fetch https://tiktok.palmyr.ai/v1/post \
  -m POST \
  -b '{"account_id":"my-brand","caption":"We shipped.","video_url":"https://example.com/launch.mp4"}'
```

TikTok actions are asynchronous. Poll `poll_url` until `done` is `true`. Never resubmit an accepted action while it is still running; payment has already settled for that operation.
