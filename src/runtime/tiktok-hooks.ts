/**
 * Hook analysis — which openings actually earn views on YOUR accounts.
 *
 * A "hook" is the first thing a viewer reads: the opening line of the caption,
 * before the hashtags. Its job is to stop the scroll, and on TikTok that is
 * what drives distribution — the algorithm promotes what holds attention in the
 * opening seconds. So views (not engagement rate) is the honest proxy for hook
 * quality: engagement rate measures whether the CONTENT landed with the people
 * who watched, views measure whether the opening earned an audience at all.
 *
 * Everything here is measured against the account's OWN history. Cross-account
 * comparison is meaningless — a 2M-follower account's median beats a new
 * account's best post regardless of the writing — so "good" always means "good
 * relative to what this account usually does".
 *
 * Two honesty rules are load-bearing, because the failure mode of a system like
 * this is confident nonsense from three data points:
 *
 *   1. A pattern seen fewer than MIN_CONFIDENT_POSTS times reports its numbers
 *      but is NOT marked confident. Two posts is an anecdote.
 *   2. Posts younger than the maturity window are excluded from the comparison
 *      entirely. A post from this morning has fewer views than one from last
 *      month for reasons that have nothing to do with its hook, and mixing
 *      the two makes every recent hook look bad.
 *   3. Posts OLDER than the recency window are excluded too, because hooks
 *      decay. An opening that printed views eighteen months ago can be dead
 *      today, and averaging it in launders a stale pattern into a current
 *      recommendation. Every report states the span it covers.
