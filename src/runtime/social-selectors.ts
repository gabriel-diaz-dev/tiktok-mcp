/**
 * Resilient element resolution for browser-driven social ops.
 *
 * TikTok and X rotate their internal `data-e2e` test-ids and class names
 * without notice — when they do, a single hard-coded selector turns a healthy,
 * authenticated session into a UI_TIMEOUT. This module applies the lesson from
 * accessibility-tree-driven agents (e.g. Hermes): resolve an element by an
 * ORDERED list of strategies, preferring stable semantics (ARIA role +
 * accessible name) and falling back through aria-label / text / structural
 * matches.
 *
 * The unambiguous `data-e2e` is tried first — when it's valid the happy path is
 * instant and behaviour is unchanged. The durable role/text layers only engage
 * once TikTok rotates the id, which is exactly when the old code would have
 * broken. When every strategy misses, `axSnapshot` captures the page's
 * accessibility tree (role + name of each interactive node) for the failure
 * payload — that's both a human-debuggable record of what rotated and the exact
 * input a vision fallback would consume if we add one later.

/**
 * Wait until the content an operation is about to query has actually rendered.
 *
 * This exists because of a defect that made four of five TikTok operations fail
 * in production for months, each with a different and confidently wrong error.
 * Every op navigated with `domcontentloaded` and then waited on a readiness
 * signal that renders EARLIER than the content it needed — the Studio search
 * box, or a profile page whose auth-gated action buttons hydrate last. The wait
 * was satisfied by an empty shell, the query found nothing, and the op blamed a
 * rotated selector, an already-followed account, or an already-deleted post.
 * Live validation caught each one: delete's failure dump listed only the Studio
 * navigation and zero post rows; follow's screenshot showed a fully-rendered
 * profile whose action buttons were still grey skeletons.
 *
 * So: gate on a predicate that is true only once the REAL content exists, and
 * let the caller distinguish "not ready" from "genuinely absent" — they need
 * different errors and different retry decisions.
 *
 * `predicate` is a JS expression evaluated in the page; its resolved value is
 * returned so a caller can branch on WHICH state was reached (a truthy string,
 * say) rather than just a boolean. Returns null on timeout — never throws, and
 * never silently swallows the timeout the way `.catch(() => {})` did.
